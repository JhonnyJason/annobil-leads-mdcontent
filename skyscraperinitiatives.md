As part of our plans to contribute to a better educational system, ALN will partner with resource personels to embark on the skyscraper leadership initiative which will seek to organize seminars, conferences, training and skill acquisition and mentorship programs, counselling and sex educational programs and many more through online platforms and at the village information centres.

One major challenge faced by rural communities and villages is the inability to afford basic needs. This often leads to sexual exploitation of teenage girls, eventually resulting to the increase in the level of teenage pregnacy, school dropouts, streetism and early marriages. ALN plans to successfully execute this rescue program which will seek to donate items in form of school supplies, sanitary supplies, food, drinking water, bags, shoes, clothing, stationery and many more.

Poverty rate, unemployment, substandard, dilapidated and complete lack of educational facilities, unavailable healthcare facilities are some of the few major challenges in the rural communities. These are major contribution to academic failure, increase in poverty rate and social vices, rural-urban migration, high mortality rate, loss of pregnancy and many more.

In order to reduce the negative effects of these factors, ALN will team up with international communities, organisations and partners,government institutions, local chiefs, school authorities and the general public in order to provide quality educational and health facilities which will be accessible to all. 

Also there will be job settlements, support for start ups and set ups in technical vocations such as hairdressing, tailoring, pastries making, and many more in order to provide sustainable job opportunities in the various rural communities.
