One major challenge faced by rural communities and villages is the inability to afford basic needs. This often leads to sexual exploitation of teenage girls, eventually resulting to the increase in the level of teenage pregnacy, school dropouts, streetism and early marriages. ALN plans to successfully execute this rescue program which will seek to donate items in form of school supplies, sanitary supplies, food, drinking water, bags, shoes, clothing, stationery and many more.
