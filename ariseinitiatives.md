Poverty rate, unemployment, substandard, dilapidated and complete lack of educational facilities, unavailable healthcare facilities are some of the few major challenges in the rural communities. These however are major contributions to academic failure, increase in poverty rate and social vices, rural-urban migration, high mortality and morbidity rate, loss of pregnancy and many more.

In order to reduce the negative effects of these factors, ALN will team up with international communities, organisations and partners, government institutions, local chiefs, school authorities and the general public in order to provide quality educational and health facilities which will be accessible to all. 

Also there will be job settlements, support for start ups and set ups in technical vocations such as hairdressing, tailoring, catering, cosmetology and many more in order to provide sustainable job opportunities in the various rural communities.
